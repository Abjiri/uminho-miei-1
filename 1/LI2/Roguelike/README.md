# Roguelike

This project consisted of implementing a Coffeebreak Roguelike game characterized by having simple rules, being quick to play and being particularly deadly.
See the project statement [here](statement.pdf). :smile:

The project implementation was done in a CGI in C, in the Linux operating system.

It was done in the 2nd semester of our 1st year in the Computer Software Engineering course.
