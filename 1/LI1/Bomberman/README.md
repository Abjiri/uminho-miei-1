# Bomberman

The project consists on small Haskell applications that should respond to different tasks. The goal is to implement the classic Bomberman game in battle mode. The overall idea of the game is to strategically place bombs to kill enemies and destroy obstacles on the map.

Check the project statement [here](statement.pdf) and the final report [here](tex/RelatorioFinal.pdf). :smile:

It was a game made in Haskell and for the final report we used LaTeX.

It was done in the 1st semester of the Computer Software Engineering course at Computer Labs I.
